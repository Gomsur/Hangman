Welcome Gomsur,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **August 17, 2021**

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

-----
Happy coding!


# Hangman

## Introduction
Hangman is a classic game that puts your brain to work.
In this nostalgic game the user decides which category they would like to play.
When the user chose a category the game begins and the user gets 8 tries of guessing the correct word.
If the user guess a word incorrect, the stickman starts getting filled out.
The game ends with either a full stickman which would be a loss, or if the user guesses the correct word before the stickman gets hung.

## Planning stage
### Target Audience
- A game for all ages
- English speaking/writing users
- Users who want a nostalgic touch of gaming

### User Stories
- As a user I want to choose between different word categories
- As a user I want to see how many letters the word includes
- As a user I want the game to be re-playable if lost
- As a user I want to get an introduction of how many lives I have
- As a user I want to count the hangman parts to calculate how many tries I have left

### Site aims
- Providing a nostalgic runnable game
- Giving the user a choice of categories based on their interest
-
